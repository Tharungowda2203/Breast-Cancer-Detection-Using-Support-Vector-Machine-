# Breast-Cancer-Detection-Using-Support-Vector-Machine-
Breast cancer detection using Support Vector Machine (SVM) to classify tumors as benign or malignant. This project uses the UCI Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset, focusing on data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation. It aims to provide an efficient, non-invasive tool for early cancer detection.
